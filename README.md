# dmgo - a gameboy emulator in native go

I put together dmgo in about a week and half over the holidays. Much is left to be done, but things have progessed enough to throw it up on here.

#### Features:
 * Audio (on windows)!
 * Many games playable!
 * Glitches are relatively rare but still totally happen!
 * Graphical cross-platform support in native golang, with no hooks into C libraries needed.
 
That last bit relies on exp/shiny, which is still a work in progress. Let me know if it fails on your platform.
